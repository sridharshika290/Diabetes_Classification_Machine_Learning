# 🏥 Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning 🤖📊  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can save lives and improve quality of life. In this project, we use **Machine Learning (ML)** to classify whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. 💉🔬  

Our model takes patient health parameters as input and predicts diabetes risk with high accuracy! 🎯  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Preprocessing of medical data** (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)  
✅ **Multiple ML models** tested (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ **Hyperparameter tuning** for better performance ⚙️  
✅ **Performance evaluation** with precision, recall, and accuracy 📊  
✅ **Interactive visualizations** for insights 📈  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack   
🔹 **Jupyter Notebook** 📓  

## 📂 Dataset  
We used the **JohnDaSilva's Diabetes Dataset** 🏥 from Kaggle/UCI, containing medical records like:  
✔️ Glucose Level  
✔️ Blood Pressure  
✔️ BMI  
✔️ Insulin Level  
✔️ Age, etc.  

## ⚡ Model Training & Evaluation  
We trained multiple models and compared their performance:  
📌 **Logistic Regression** - Simple but effective 🔹  
📌 **Random Forest** - Handles non-linearity well 🌲  
📌 **SVM** - Great for high-dimensional data 🔄  
📌 **KNN** - Distance-based classification 🔍  

## 🎨 Visualizations  
🔸 Heatmaps to show correlations 🔥  
🔸 Feature importance charts 📊  
🔸 ROC curves for model performance 🚀
